# MiniAmazon
In July 1995, Amazon began service as an online bookstore. Suppose that you were Jeff Bezos and you are going to build your own multi-tier web application for selling books! In this project, you will understand the most commonly used multi-tier web application which includes a logic tier and a data tier. Users’ http requests such as browsing books and placing orders will be sent to the logic tier. The logic tier will then query a book database in the data tier. The database will response to the queries back to the logic tier and finally the logic tier will assemble the html page and response to the user. Anybody in the world will be able to access your MiniAmazon to browse books and place orders. Moreover, the construction details will strictly follow the industrial standard TPC Benchmark™ W (TPC-W) which is a transactional web benchmark.
